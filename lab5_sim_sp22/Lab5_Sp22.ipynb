    "Now we have the two-stage notch filter on the Tinkercad breadboard. Same as what you did in Part 2.2, record the peak-to-peak output amplitude at different frequencies (1Hz, 10Hz, 100Hz, 1000Hz) and replace the **ellipsis** for variable nf_vpp_sim in following with these amplitudes. Then, run the code and plot the waveforms. We draw the frequency responses of the band-pass filter and notch filter in one plot. *Compare the simulation and calculation results.*\n"
