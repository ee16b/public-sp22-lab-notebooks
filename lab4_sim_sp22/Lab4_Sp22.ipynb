For the same reason, the GND of Arduino was also connected to -2.5V rail (-Vss rail) rather than the Gnd rail.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Hit `Start Simulation`.** \n",
    "4. Open the serial plotter by clicking on `Code > Serial Monitor > Graph`. You may need to wait for a while to see the waveform (the waiting time will be longer when the frequency becomes higher). *Does the output look like what you expect?*\n",
    "    - You may find that the offset voltage of the serial monitor waveform is 2.5V. The reason is that the Arduino GND is connected to -Vss supply instead of GND.\n",

The transfer function's magnitude is defined by the ratio of the peak-to-peak amplitudes between the output and input (input peak-to-peak amplitude is 4V).  <span style=\"color:#ba190f\">Enter a numerical value with two decimal places in V (e.g. 3.14).**\n",

    "<span style=\"color:#075a04\"> **14. Consider the edge case again when we apply a DC signal to the input of the high-pass filter (i.e. directly connect a power supply to it). Which of the following statements is true? Please choose all the answers that are correct.**\n",

    "- A. The DC signal does not pass through the high-pass filter as the filter output is independent of the input DC voltage.\n",
