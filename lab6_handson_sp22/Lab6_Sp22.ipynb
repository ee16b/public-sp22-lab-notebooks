    "With our circuits for enabling S1XT33N to drive around and pick up your voice, it's now time to start working on getting S1XT33N to drive in a straight line. Before we can do that, however, we need information on how \"good\" S1XT33N's motors actually are when they're driving on the ground; we want to know how sensitive they are to changes in the input, how much friction they experience, etc. Using that information, we can then determine what input PWM duty cycles to feed the motors so that they move at the same speed. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Materials:\n",
    "- Launchpad + USB cable\n",
    "- Car with encoders installed\n",
    "- 2 plastic encoder wheels (black plastic wheel with lots of rectangular holes)\n",
    "- Power supply\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are two major types of error in sensing the car's trajectory. The first is noise in the sensor signals. The second is from mechanical differences between the two sides of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will test for and fix the first type of noise. The mechanical type primarily affects performance over long distances, so we can compensate for it after implementing closed-loop control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks: \n",
    "1. Connect the Launchpad's USB.\n",
    "2. **Connect one of the ground pins on the Launchpad to the ground rail of your breadboard.**\n",
    "3. Power your motors with 9V from the +25V channel on the power supply (connect it to the switch like from Lab 3). **Set the current limit to 0.4 A**. \n",
    "4. Power your regulators' inputs (\"Regulator 9V Rail\") with the same +25V channel on the power supply as well.\n",
    "5. **Connect the input resistor (the 1.5k ohm resistor) of the left motor's driver circuit to `P2.0` and the input resistor of the right motor's driver circuit to `P1.5`.** (Connect the pins to the ends of the resistors that are NOT connected to the base pin of the BJT).\n",
    "6. **If your encoders are powered properly, the LEDs on each one should blink when you pass something through the encoders or turn the wheels slowly.** \n",
    "7. If you've disconnected them, connect pins `P6.2` and `P6.3` to the outputs of the resistive dividers of the left and right encoders, respectively.\n",
    "8. Remove the encoder wheels (the plastic disk with holes in it) if they are on the car. Upload **`encoder_test_0_ticks.ino`** to the Launchpad.\n",
    "9. Open the serial monitor.\n",
    "10. **Set the baud rate to `38400`**.\n",
    "11. Press reset (RST) button on Launchpad.\n",
    "12. Follow the instructions on the serial monitor.\n",
    "    - **Your car wheels are going to move. Make sure that you hold the car above the table/ground. Don't let your car jump off the table.**\n",
    "    - `P2.1` is the bottom left button of the Launchpad.\n",
    "    - The test will conduct 4 phases: both wheels at rest, only left wheel driving, only right wheel driving, and both wheels driving.\n",
    "    - If your encoders are functioning properly, the serial monitor should print \"Success\" or \"Success if encoder wheels are off\" after each phase, and display all 0s (or at least no more than a few ticks) for the ticks per phase. Note that if your car is mis-wired, this could be a false negative.\n",
    "    - This diagnostics message will be followed up by a long and repeating string of the actual values measured during the duration of the program. If you want to look at just the encoder diagnostics, make sure to untick `Autoscroll` in the bottom left of the Serial Monitor window.\n",
    "13. Attach the encoder wheels as shown below.\n",
    "    - If it is on, make sure to remove the paper sticker from your car frame if there is one (yes, it does come off) before you attach the encoders.\n",
    "    - If some of the holes on the encoder wheel were not fully cut out, use a screwdriver to push the material out.\n",
    "14. Re-run the tests. If your car is connected correctly, **the tests should show several hundred encoder ticks** after all the tests have been run, ruling out a false negative. You should also see it print \"Success\" or \"Failure if encoder wheels are off. Success if encoder wheels are on\" after each test.\n",

The maximum voltage on the Launchpad can tolerate on its pins depends on whether or not the Launchpad is powered. When the Launchpad isn't powered, the maximum voltage is ~0.2V, so leaving any signal connected to the pins can risk frying the pin and/or the Launchpad.\n",
    "- Make sure the ground pin of your Launchpad is connected to your breadboard ground.\n",
    "- Ideally, the general procedure for interacting with your Launchpad is:\n",
    "    a) Power your Launchpad (whether through USB or the 5V regulator). No input pins should be connected to the Launchpad.\n",
    "    b) Connect the breadboard ground to your Launchpad ground.\n",
    "    c) Connect any input pins from your Launchpad to the breadboard. \n",
    "- If you find plugging in your input pins each time annoying, you can leave them attached to the Launchpad **as long as you unplug the 9V input to your regulators before you disconnect power from your Launchpad.**"

Glance through the sketch - it records the position of each wheel while varying the input signal $u[i]$ linearly from HIGH_PWM to LOW_PWM and back up. The sampling period is $T_s = 500\\mathrm{ms}$. A long sampling period is used to minimize error due to quantization, which manifests as rounding error from measuring only integer encoder ticks.\n",

    "**Important: For this first test, make sure that you are using the first set of 5 parameters in code block `SID1`** (abbreviated from System ID 1). These parameters will sweep through a range of PWM values, from 200 to 100 and back to 200 (the maximimum value a PWM can have is 255 and minimum is 0), while collecting 2 samples per PWM. The car will start fast, slow down, and speed back up during the test (it's possible that the car may stop in the middle before driving again if a PWM of 100 is not enough to get it to drive).\n",

    "1. We will being using **`dynamics_data.ino`** to collect data for our car and read it to the serial monitor.\n",
    "2. Upon being uploaded to the MSP, **`dynamics_data.ino`** has two functions depending on the **`WRITE`** variable at the top of the code:\n",
    "    - If **`WRITE == 1`** - The car upon having the leftmost bottom button pressed will run and collect data, then write it into nonvolatile (permanent) memory called flash, which will survive between resets and power supply removal, unlike volatile memory like RAM. The collected data will be overwritten if data collection is run again.\n",
    "    - If **`WRITE == 0`** - The car upon having its leftmost bottom button pressed will read data collected from its last run that is stored in flash and output it onto the Serial Monitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some items to remember when collecting data:\n",
    "- Remember that the MSP needs power from 5V pin if not connected via USB cable to the computer. **However, don't connect both, as this fries your Launchpad.**\n",
    "- Look for a large space to run your car. The long hallways outside Cory 125 are good locations. You want to try to minimize the number of collisions it makes with the objects or walls around it for the best data.\n",
    "- **Secure your MSP** to your car so that it does not fall off while the car is moving! **Be careful to not short any Launchpad pins with other electrical components on your car like the breadboard and encoders. They should not be touching.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some debugging tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your motors don't run, make sure you've flip the switch to connect the motors to 9V.\n",
    "- **The leftmost button is unresponsive at times, so you may have to press it multiple times. You will know you have succeeded in making the MSP bend to your will if the LEDs blink.** If things are still unresponsive, press the reset (RST) button on the Launchpad.\n",
    "- If your car makes *very* tight circles (ie: radius less than 1 ft), talk to your GSI! Some quick fixes may be:\n",
    "    - Check to see if your motor wheels are turning in the right direction (the back of the car is the castor wheel).\n",
    "    - Making sure the castor wheel (the white wheel that swivels) is aligned with your car (straight, and not turned at an angle) before running dynamics_data.ino. You may need to accomplish this by restraining the sides of the wheel with either wires or tape.\n",
    "    - Using a smaller range of PWM values (i.e. 90-150 instead of 100-200)\n",
    "    - If you fry one of your PWM pins, you can use one of the other PWM pins, which are `P1.4`, `P1.5`, `P2.0`, `P2.4`, and `P2.5`."

    "### 3.4. Least-Squares Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have some data, we can try performing least-squares regression. Try to think about what least-squares problem we are solving, what equations are we using, and what the variables we are solving for mean.\n",

    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes the data as parameters, performs least squares, and extracts the parameters. The functions [`np.hstack`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.hstack.html), [`np.ones`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html), [`np.shape`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.shape.html), [`np.linalg.lstsq`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html) will be helpful here.\n",
    "    - If you are having trouble figuring out how to setup the least-squares problem, check the lab note for some helpful insight.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Call the function once for each wheel.\n",

    "    - Make sure that the fitted lines have some y values in common! That way we know both wheels can attain the same speed.\n",
    "    - If they don't, the plot for the operating point in Part 4 will fail. You will need to recollect your fine data with a different, and likely wider, PWM range.\n",
    "2. **If you think a different range of PWM may be more linear, change HIGH_PWM and LOW_PWM in the .ino file.**\n",
    "    - Be careful so your car does not run too close to the minimum or maximum PWM (0 and 255).\n",

A good choice of target velocity is the midpoint of the overlapping range of velocity. The below cell will calculate this. We will use this value in the next lab (Lab 7: Controls), along with the theta and beta values calculated earlier for both wheels."
